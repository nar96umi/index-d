    <p style color="red"> my name is Naomi Wanjiru Mukuhi and this is my little
      something about me.</p>
    <ul>
        i was born around mt. kenya region where my educaton was centered most of my life
        time which was good and i liked it there. sometimes i am a bit time sensative and also maybe
        a bit impatient.
        wouldnt call my self comfortably confident as i have this absurd phobia of crowds and interaction which with my peers
        seems silly at times that i know. other than that, nothing much interesting about me but the following are some of my
        favorite things i like to do when i have time to myself which with most sounds barbaric. never known why someone isnt allowed to have
        some time to themselves, wierd. anyway back to topic at hand, my hobbies;
          <ol>
            <li>a bit of drawing is something that i enjoy doing</li>
            <li>writing sometimes, world of fiction has always been a fascination to me.</li>
            <li>reading novels, but i prefer doing this online.</li>
          </ol>
      aside from that, what picture would i say describes me best, they are several but i think the following will do
      for the moment;

        this i believe will explain it well. good day!   
    </ul>
